# a4: Predicting Dengue

In this assignment, we aim to predict the Dengue cases in San Juan and Iquitos through machine learning. We started off by doing some data preparation: we firstly loaded the training and test data file into dataframes, and then added features that we thought may be useful based on our domain knowledge, as well as dropped the ones we knew would be useless with the experience from a3. The missing value is handled with forward fill, which we thought was best approach because it will not be largely affected by the skewness and the possible visualization will look appropriate. Then we did some feature engineering and selection: we created nine new features (time lagged variables and average value variables) based on domain knowledge, and then we decided to divide the dataset based on the two cities, as those two cities may have different patterns in terms of the Dengue cases spreading, finally the most relevant features were selected through two the low variance and univariate feature selection strategies. Next we entered the statistical modeling stage: we chose KNN Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor and Ada Boost Regressor as our models because our outcome of interest (total number of Dengue cases) is a quantity; we performed cross validation as well as grid-search on those models, and the training dataset was split into smaller training and testing dataset for model training; one thing to notice is that the scaler was only used on the KNN Regressor since it is the only one that requires somewhat normalization. For the validation and visualization: horizontal bar graphs were used to compare the mean absolute error scores of different models for each city and scores of RandomForestRegressor with different parameters were also visualized through heat map. From the graph we conclude KNN is the best model, and thus it was used to predict the data using the given competition test data file.
